                <p id="def">Definition: <br>
                    Social media is a form of digital communication that allows users <br>
                    to form online networks and communities for socializing, sharing<br>
                    information, and posting user-created content.</p>
                <p class="media">
                <h3>What Is Social Media? </h3><br>
                Social media refers to online platforms where users can share information and connect with virtual <br>
                communities through text, video, photos, and other content. As of 2024, social media had more than <br>
                five billion global users, which is equal to more than 62% of the world population.<br>
                DataReportal. “Digital 2024: Global Overview Report.”<br>

                This includes apps or websites designed for messaging and chat, social platforms<br>
                (like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok), and community forums, such as Reddit and Discord.</p>

                <h3>Origins and Evolution of Social Media</h3>
                Early social media platforms, such as MySpace and LiveJournal, were designed for people to connect
                with<br>
                friends and family. MySpace, which allowed users to create personal profile pages and share information
                about<br>
                themselves, became the first network to reach one million active monthly users in 2004.<br>
                LiveJournal, a platform where users could share journal-like entries with either public or private
                networks,
                reached <br>
                over 2.5 million active accounts in 2005.<br>
                Social media use grew rapidly in the 2000s and early 2010s as Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) became
                popular.<br>
                Like MySpace, Facebook users create profiles to share information about themselves, while other users
                leave
                comments.<br>
                Initially used for socializing among college-age users, social media became popular with younger and
                older
                users.<br>
                In 2006, X's launch included its feed feature, where posts from accounts that a user followed were
                aggregated onto a <br>
                single page.<br>
                History. "2006: Twitter Launches."<br>
                Facebook launched its own News Feed feature.<br>
                The news feed became a standard feature for many social media platforms.<br>
                More users began posting links to external sites, where news stories, current events, and product pages
                could be <br>
                shared with personal updates. Users could interact with each other's content, including liking, sharing,
                and<br>
                commenting on posts.<br>
                <p class="media">
                    During this time, social media platforms began adding business-specific profile pages and the
                    ability to
                    purchase targeted<br>
                    ads that other users would see, making them more business-friendly and increasing revenue for the
                    platforms.<br>
                    Social media users began spending more time scrolling through feeds and consuming daily news and
                    commentary on current<br>
                    events. By 2024, just over half (54%) of adults in the U.S. said they get their news from social
                    media
                    "sometimes" or "often."<br>
                    Only 28% of U.S. adults say they "never" get the news from social media.<br>
                    Globally, only 22% of consumers get their news directly from news websites or apps, with younger
                    news
                    consumers the least <br>
                    likely to do so. </p>
                </p>
                <p class="media">
                <h3>How Social Media Is Used Today
                </h3>
                As users continued to spend more time on social media sites, different types of social media platforms
                evolved.
                They can be broadly categorized as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Social networks: Facebook, NextDoor</li>
                    <li>Microblogging: X, BlueSky, Mastodon, Threads</li>
                    <li>Long-form blogging: Substack, Ghost</li>
                    <li>Professional networking: LinkedIn, Behance, ResearchGate</li>
                    <li>Video and photo sharing: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat</li>
                    <li>Visual curation and search: Pinterest, Houzz, DeviantArt</li>
                    <li>Messaging: WhatsApp, Signal, WeChat, Marco Polo</li>
                    <li>Community forums: Reddit, Discord, Clubhouse</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Platforms are oriented toward different uses and users. Some may be used purely for socializing, while
                others are <br>
                oriented toward professional network building or job-hunting. Some platforms allow users to connect with
                others who <br>
                share their political views or leisure hobbies.
                <br>
                Many social media users are acting in a professional capacity. For instance:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actors and writers can use social media to connect with fans of their work</li>
                    <li>Politicians use them to communicate with constituents and voters</li>
                    <li>Nonprofit organizations may use them to promote charitable causes or collect donations</li>
                    <li>Government agencies can use social media to communicate with the public during emergencies.</li>
                </ul>
                Posting content on social media, either sponsored by a business or funded through follower support, can
                also
                be a job in <br>
                itself, separate from any outside work that the social media posts are promoting. These types of social
                media users are<br>
                generally referred to as influencers or content creators. One in five social media users consider
                themselves
                professional <br>
                content creators.
                <br>
                Social media is also an important form of marketing for many companies. Businesses use social media to
                identify and capitalize on <br>
                consumer trends, engage with customers, collect consumer data, and pay for targeted advertising. Many
                also
                work with influencers,<br>
                paying content creators to promote their products or services directly to the influencers' audience or
                followers.<br>
                </p>

                </h3>
                <h2> Pros
                </h2>
                <ul class="box">

                    <li>Affordable advertising</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Cons
                </h2>
                <ul class="box">
                    <li>Disinformation/misinformation</li>
                    <li>Sleep disruption</li>
                    <li>Mental health impact</li>
                    <li>Child sexual exploitation</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Advantages Explained</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connectivity: Social media platforms allow people to access global information and connect with
                        friends<br>
                        and family at a distance. It can allow users to find niche communities around their interests or
                        current<br>
                        needs, such as neighborhood forums or job searching.</li><br>
                    <li>Build community: Using social media is correlated to having more friends and a personal network
                        with greater diversity,<br>
                        especially in emerging economies. Social media users are more likely to interact with those who
                        are different from them<br>
                        across categories of income, political party, religion, or ethnicity.</li><br>
                    <li>Affordable advertising: Small businesses and creators can reach potential customers at low price
                        points through targeted ads <br>
                        and influencer marketing. More than 200 million small businesses use Facebook.<br>
                        In 2024, online advertising, including social media and search advertising, accounted for 59% of
                        global ad spending; that number<br>
                        is projected to grow to 61% in 2026.<br></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Disadvantages Explained</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disinformation/misinformation: The ease of sharing links and posts on social media can
                        facilitate the spread of<br>
                        disinformation or misinformation. For instance, misinformation about Hurricane Helene hampered

                    <li>Sleep disruption: Social media use is correlated with less and poor quality sleep, especially
                        among teens and young adults.<br>
                        Poor sleep is associated with a variety of health problems, including heart disease, high blood
                        pressure, diabetes, obesity, and depression.</li> <br>
                    <li>Mental health impact: Research has also found a direct correlation between more social media use
                        and higher rates of depression among teens.<br>
                        Other mental health concerns related to social media use include bullying, peer pressure,
                        spreading rumors about peers and friends, and the<br>
                        creation of unrealistic expectations based on exposure to other people's lives.</li><br>
                    <li>Child sexual abuse: In 2022, research found that more than one in six U.S. children experience
                        sexual abuse online.<br>
                        Studies in other countries have found even higher rates. Social media can provide a platform for
                        child sexual abuse <br>
                        and exploitation including grooming, stalking, sharing of explicit materials, revenge
                        pornography, and nonconsensual sexting.</li><br>

                list globally. X was 14th, <br>
                with 586 million users worldwide, while Pinterest was 16th with 537 million.

                <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                Since the early 2000s, social media has reshaped how people interact online, impacting community
                building, news, politics,<br>
                entertainment, and advertising. Despite the downsides, including the spread of misinformation and child
                sexual exploitation, <br>
                social media continues to grow each year.<br>

                With more than five billion users worldwide spending an average of over two hours per day on its apps
                and websites,<br>
                social media has become one of the most important ways for individuals, businesses, creators, and
                politicians to<br>
                connect with one another.
